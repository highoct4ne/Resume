<h1>More about me and my hobbies!</h1>
<p>I really enjoy playing video games, I have been gaming since I was a kid. The same goes for sports
    growing up I played soccer, basketball, and football. I have always been very outdoorsy as well and currently I love to hike, other things I want to get into are scuba diving, skiing, and parachuting which I have done once but I would like to get my license.
